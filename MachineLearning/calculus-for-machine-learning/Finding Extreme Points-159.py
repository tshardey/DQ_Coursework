## 3. Differentiation ##

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(-5, 6, 110)

y = -2**x+3

plt.plot(x, y)

## 6. Power Rule ##

slope_one = 5*2**4
slope_two = 0 

## 7. Linearity Of Differentiation ##

slope_three = 5-1

slope_four = 3*2**2 - 2*2

## 8. Practicing Finding Extreme Values ##

rel_min = [(2/3)]
rel_max = [0]
